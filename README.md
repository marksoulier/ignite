3 steps for making changes to models 

Change your models (in models.py).
Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.

models can be applied so several objects can be connected to another object. This is done by using a foreign key.

go to the admin site.

views is the way that django shows content to the user.

each view is a python function that takes a web request and returns a web response.

Django will choose a view by examining the URL thatâ€™s requested (to be precise, the part of the URL after the domain name).
