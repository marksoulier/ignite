    <p>This website is a project of IEEE to create a platform where students can post their engineering projects. The advantage of doing so is that other students can see what each other are doing, as well as faculty and the industry. Each participant can have up to 3 projects on the platform, and we encourage every student to post their top 3 projects.</p>
